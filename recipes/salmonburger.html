    <h1>Fresh Salmon Burgers with Lemon-Yoghurt Sauce</h1>
    <p><img src="../img/salmon.jpeg" width="600" alt="A delicous looking salmon burger"></p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These are a little like crab cakes, but they're made with fresh salmon and grilled. 
           The secret to juicy (not pasty!) salmon burgers is to chop the salmon coarsely with a knife.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2,5 pounds salmon filet, skin and pin bones removed</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>2/3 cup finely chopped parsley</li>
            <li>1/4 cup finely chopped green onions</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup plain dried bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon seafood seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Chop salmon into 1/8- to 1/4-inch pieces. Transfer to a bowl with 2 eggs,
                2/3 cup parsley, 1/4 cup green onions, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, bread crumbs,
                seafood seasoning, 1/2 tablespoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
            </li>
            <li>Stir together yoghurt, mayo, parsley, onion, lemon juice, salt and pepper
                in a small bowl
            </li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill to medium heat</li>
            <li>Brush patties with oil. Oil grate. Grill patties, turning carefully until
                cooked through and a thermometer inserted in center of each patty registers 
                160 degrees F, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Serve on buns with sauce and arugula.
            </li>
        </ol>
